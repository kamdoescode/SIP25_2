### Design Notes
- the sketch uses 3D perlin noise to create the organic looking pattern. The third dimension (zoff) is animated to create flowing changes frame by frame
- I chose the split colors to mimic the surface of water
- The 'scale', 'threshold', and 'zoff' parameters can be adjusted to customize the sketch
