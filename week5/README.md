# Design Notes 
<p>Comic Book: The reel of screengrabs I've uploaded is me eating my lunch. Enjoy. </p>

<p>Challenges: Had trouble getting the filter and dithering to work simultaneously. Had to look into quantization to calculate error. 
 Also, the keypressed function to save screengrabs to the data took oddly under-exposed photos that aren't accurate to how the sketch looks when running.  
 You can find the photo as the file `failed-screengrab.jpg` in the `week5_task` folder. 
 </p>

<p> There is also an overarching issue I was unable to solve regarding how the sketch looks while running.
  There is a continous flashing that occurs when the sketch is running, this could be due to the frequency of the lighting in the room vs the framerate of the camera.
    Unfortunately I could find no solution to this. </p>

<p> Also, when screeenrecording the sketch, the quality went down exponentially.  
  This could be because the graphics and camera drivers are under more load, worsened by the flashing issue. </p>
