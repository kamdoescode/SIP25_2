##Design Notes 
Comic Book: The reel of screengrabs I've uploaded is me eating my lunch. Enjoy.  

Challenges: Had trouble getting the filter and dithering to work simultaneously. Had to look into quantization to calculate error. ALso, the keypressed function to save screengrabs to the data took oddly under-exposed photos that aren't accurate to how the sketch looks when running.  You can find the photo titled 'frame-004794.jpg' in the 'week5_task' folder.
